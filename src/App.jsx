/**
 * PREVIOUSLY ACHIEVED:
 * 1. Set webpage structure
 * 2. Setup questions
 * 3. setup card useState to iterate through card questions
 * 4. Implemented checker to make sure cards don't go out of bounds
 * 5. Implement card flipping functionality
 * TODO:
 *
 * 2. maybe implement an counter to see which index and how many cards we have in total
